### KDB+ Web Components

# Introduction

The purpose of this library is to facilitate access to KDB+ servers from the modern web browsers as much as possible. In the extreme case all you need to do is just add two html tags
without any settings to an html page (and kdb-wc.js script) and data will be loaded and added to the page automatically.

```
<kdb-srv></kdb-srv>
<kdb-table>([] sym: 50?(5?`5);time:.z.T+til[50]*00:00:10; price: 50?40*50?1.0)</kdb-table>
```

This library is based on the new HTML5 feature - web components - entities that look like the ordinary html tags but can encapsulate arbitrary logic and perform complex tasks behind the scene. Currently not all browsers support them or enable this functionality by default thus you may need to include `document-register-element.js` library (can be found in external directory) that provides the same functionality (it is used in all examples).

This library is not intended for the production, it lacks any security, robustness and etc. It is intended for presentations, prototyping, visualizing datasets.

To use this library include `kdb-wc.js` into your html page:
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="kdb-wc.js"></script>
```

# Requirements

The library should work with IE10 (maybe IE9 too), the latest Firefox and Chrome and probably all other modern browsers.

Some other libraries may be needed (all with open source licenses like MIT):
* [`document-register-element.js`](https://github.com/WebReflection/document-register-element) - required if document.registerElement is not supported.
* [`c.js`](http://code.kx.com/wsvn/code/kx/kdb%2B/c/c.js) - serialization/deserialization of KDB objects for Websocket.
* [`c3`](http://c3js.org) - charts library C3.
* [`d3`](https://d3js.org/) - charts library D3 (C3 is based on it).
* [`dygraph`](http://dygraphs.com) - another charts library for timeseries.
* [`jsgrid`](http://js-grid.com/) - grid library.
* [`jquery`](http://jquery.com) - jquery (required by jsgrid).
* [`ace`](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/) - ace editor.

All libraries can be found in `external` directory.

# Components

## kdb-srv

The core of the library is `kdb-srv` component. It allows users to execute arbitrary queries either via an Ajax http request or via a websocket. It supports string and binary protocols for websockets and json, xml and sting data formats.

`kdb-srv` can be used with the default .z.ph handler. You may need to add `fix-json` attribute if your .z.ph fails to process queries like 'json? query'.

Websockets allow you to connect to any server not just the default one. You can even load your page as 'file://' and still be able to use them. You should though set the correct ws handler on the target server because the default .z.ws does nothing - use `srv.q` as an example.

Example:
```
# default http srv with json format (beware of 3.2 json issue)
<kdb-srv></kdb-srv>
# websocket srv with an optional k-srv-uri setting
<kdb-srv k-srv-type="ws" k-srv-uri="localhost:5566" debug="true"></kdb-srv>
```

Supported attributes:
* `k-return-type` - optional, `json` by default. Data format returned by the server. It can be `json`, `xml`, `q` or `txt`. Websockets support `json` and `q`. Http - `json`, `xml`, `txt`.
* `k-srv-type` - optional, ws or http (default).
* `k-feed` - optional, valid only for websockets. If true the first query establishes a subscription and then all data from the connection will be sent to it.
* `k-srv-uri` - optional, target websocket server. Format: "host:port". By default it is the current web server.
* `k-srv-user` - optional, a user for http requests.
* `k-srv-pass` - optional, a password for http requests.
* `k-target` - optional, a server name or `k-id` of an element with this name. It can be used with `srv.q` to turn it into a proxy. Queries will be executed via `srv.q` on another server.
* `k-prefix` - optional, a prefix to be added to every query. `xml? ` for example. It is set to either `json? ` or `jsn? ` if it is not provided and the result type is `json`.
* `k-id` - optional, this id can be used to link other components to this one.
* `fix-json` - optional, if it is set kdb-srv will send an additional query to fix a json serialization issue in the default .z.ph in kdb+ 3.2(it will set .h.tx[\`jsn] to .j.j').
* `debug` - optional. Can be set to true to see debug prints in the browser console.

Api:
* `runQuery(query,callBack)` or `runQuery(query)` - execute a query and return the result via `callBack`. `callBack` is optional and should accept two parameters - result and error.

## kdb-query

`kdb-query` encapsulates a query, searches for its parameters, executes it, distributes the result to its consumers. It can be attached to only one `kdb-srv` but can be used by many data consumers or data providers.

`kdb-table` and `kdb-chart` components can create `kdb-query` implicitly.

Example:
```
# basic example
<kdb-query>til 10</kdb-query>

# you can set srv explicitly, assign k-id, update another html element with the result, turn on debug prints, use k-id references to parametrize the query
<kdb-query k-srv="srv2" k-id="q1" k-update-elements="pre" debug="true">.Q.s
   `select`txt`pass`check`radio`textarea`span!(`$s$;"$ft$";"$fp$";$fc$;`$fr$;"$fta$";"$t$")</kdb-query>

# multiple update
<kdb-query k-dispatch-update="true" k-update-elements="pre myObj.var">``kid1`kid2!(genRes;resForKID1;resForKID2)</kdb-query>
```

You can provide parameters to the query by using $paramKID$ format. All such entries will be substituted with the target value. Supported targets include `kdb-editor`,`select`, `textarea`, `input` with types `text`, `password`, `radio`, `checkbox` and any other element with the meaningful textContent (`span` for example).

There are also special parameters: use $i$ to refer to the number of executions (can be useful with `k-interval`), $src$ refers to the initiator of the update or `self`, $txt$ refers to the
data obtained from the initiator of the event (`load`, `timer` if src is self), $id$ refers to the k-id of the initiator, $pres$ - previous result.

`kdb-query` can update other elements with its result. The result should have the correct format - string for text elements or `kdb-editor`, list of objects (table) for `kdb-table` and `kdb-chart`,
 string array for `select` or `datalist`. It can also update any element that has `kdbUpd` function. There are 3 way the update may be done:
 * consumer can subscribe to the query via `onresult` function.
 * consumer `k-id` or var name can be added to `k-update-elements`.
 * consumer `k-ids` or var name can be set as keys of the result dictionary when `k-dispatch-update` is true. In this case the general result will be taken from key \`.

Supported attributes:
* `k-query` - optional, a query can be set either in this attribute or between the tags like in the example above.
* `k-srv` - optional, link to a `kdb-srv`. If it is not set the first available `kdb-srv` component will be used.
* `k-execute-on` - optional, list of events that cause the query to execute. Contains only `load` by default. `load` - when the document is loaded, `manual` - do not execute, `timer` - use timer, `k-id` of a button or some other html element - execute on click, k-id of `kdb-editor` - execute on its exec event, k-id of another query - execute after it (its result is available via $txt$).
* `k-update-elements` - optional, users can either subscribe to `kdb-query` events or can provide their `k-id` or var names in this attribute, in this way you can update arbitrary html elements.
* `k-dispatch-update` - optional, if true the result must be a list with keys corresponding to k-ids or var names. `kdb-query` will then distribute the result. Use key \` for `k-update-elements`.
* `k-delay` - optional, in millis. With `timer` sets the delay for the first execution.
* `k-interval` - optional, in millis. With `timer` causes query to rerun every `interval` millis. The first query will be executed with the delay of either `k-delay` or this `k-interval`.
* `k-escape-q` - optional. If set forces `kdb-query` to escape " and \\ symbols in the query parameters (not query itself!).
* `k-filter` - optional, name of a Javascript function or an object with `filter` function that will postprocess the result.
* `k-id` - optional, this id can be used to link other components to this one.
* `debug` - optional. Can be set to true to see debug prints in the browser console.

There are attributes that `kdb-query` understands on its target elements:
* `k-append` - on text elements defines how the new result is added. Possible values: 'top', 'bottom', 'overwrite'.
* `k-content-type` - text or html, how the result is added to an element: as html or text.
* `k-id` - this id can be used to link other components to `kdb-query`.

Api:
* `onresult(f)` - subscribe to 'newResult' event. If the result is already ready then `f` will be called immediately. `f` should have one parameter - result.
* `setupQuery()` - call it after you change the attributes.
* `runQuery(args)` - run the query if it was not run before. Args is an optional object like {param1:val1, ...}.
* `rerunQuery(args)` - rerun the query.

## kdb-table

`kdb-table` can be used to show a table. `kdb-table` relies on `kdb-query` to run the actual query. `kdb-query` can be set either with its `k-id` or created implicitly via `k-query` attribute or the content of the tag.

`kdb-table` can use jsGrid library to show tables. Set `k-lib` to `jsgrid`. You can also provide additional configuration to it via `k-config`

Example
```
# basic case
<kdb-table>([] sym: 50?(5?`5);time:.z.T+til[50]*00:00:10; price: 50?40*50?1.0)</kdb-table>
# update tbl from a query
<kdb-table k-id="tbl"></kdb-table>

# jsGrid
<kdb-table k-id="tbl" k-lib="jsgrid" k-style="width:800px; height: 400px;"></kdb-table>
# jsGrid, custom cfg, also k-search is set to true so search boxes are shown for columns
<kdb-table k-id="tbl3" k-search="true" k-lib="jsgrid" k-config='{"sorting": false, "heading":false}' k-style="width:800px; height: 400px;"></kdb-table>
# jsGrid - load by page large tables, see grid example for more details
<kdb-table k-query="Q" k-lib="jsgrid" k-config='{"pageLoading":true}' k-style="width:800px; height: 400px;"></kdb-table>
```

Supported attributes:
* `k-srv` - optional, will be passed to `kdb-query` if it needs to be created.
* `k-query` - optional, `k-id` link to `kdb-query` or query text itself. If it is not present the content is used as in the example above.
* `k-id` - optional, this id can be used to link other components to this one.
* `k-escape-html` - escape or not HTML symbols in the result.
* `k-lib` - can be set to `jsgrid` for more fancy tables.
* `k-search` - show search boxes in `jsgrid` tables.
* `k-config` - change the default `jsgrid` config via this attribute. It should be either a JSON string or a variable name with the config.
* `debug` - optional. Can be set to true to see debug prints in the browser console.

## kdb-chart

`kdb-chart` can be used to visualize data. It supports two chart libraries - C3 and Dygraph and can work in the following modes:
* You can provide the full correct C3/Dygrpah config. Absolutely all C3/Dygraph features are available. See chart examples.
* If the result is a table `kdb-chart` can determine params (time and data) itself. If it succeeds it will create a timeseries chart.
* If the result is a table you can also set explicitly data and time columns and line type (for C3).
* If the result is a dictionary `kdb-chart` will create a pie chart (type can be changed to donut or gauge). C3 only.
* If you set type to 'merge-config' or 'dygraph-merge-config' it will merge the provided config with its own config, in this way you can add additional params to the config.
* Finally you can set type to 'use-config' or 'dygraph-use-config' then `kdb-chart` will use your config and insert data into it. This gives you full control like in the first item.

Example:
```
# basic C3 chart updated from a query
<kdb-chart k-style='width:800px;height:400px;' k-id="c1"></kdb-chart>
# provide data/time columns, change line style
<kdb-chart k-style='width:800px;height:400px;' k-id="c2" k-time-col="time" k-data-cols="ask bid" k-chart-type="spline"></kdb-chart>
# add some options (you need to redefine type)
<kdb-chart k-style='width:800px;height:400px;' k-id="c5" k-time-col="time" k-data-cols="ask bid"
  k-chart-type="merge-config" k-config='{"data":{"type":"spline"},"axis":{"x":{"tick":{"rotate":30}}}}'></kdb-chart>

# dygraph graph
<kdb-chart k-chart-type="dygraph" k-style='width:800px;height:400px;' k-id="c3"></kdb-chart>
# dygraph with options and flow turned on
<kdb-chart k-chart-type="dygraph-merge-config" k-style='width:800px;height:400px;' k-id="c7" k-flow="true"
   k-data-cols="price" k-time-col="time" k-config='{"rollPeriod":5, "showRoller":true}'></kdb-chart>
```

It is quite easy to set a C3 config or Dygraph config - you just literaly translate it from json to dictionaries and set required data. You may set it on the html page itself
and refer to it via its name.

In case you want just visualize some simple table remember this - if you do not set time column explicitly put it before other time-like columns. The same is true for the data column(s). `kdb-chart` searches for the first good enough column.

Supported attributes:
* `k-srv` - optional, will be passed to `kdb-query` if it needs to be created.
* `k-query` - optional, `k-id` link to `kdb-query` or query text itself. If it is not present the content of the tag is used.
* `k-class` - optional, classes to pass to the wrapper.
* `k-style` - optional, style to set to the wrapper.
* `k-chart-type` - optional, chart type as in C3 manual. 'line', 'spline' and etc. `use-config` can be used to use the `k-config`, `merge-config` - merge the default config with `k-config`. In the previous two cases set the chart type manually in `k-config`. For dygraph set it to either 'dygraph', 'dygraph-merge-config' or 'dygraph-use-config'.
* `k-time-col` - optional, time column.
* `k-data-cols` - optional, data columns.
* `k-config` - optional, either a chart config in JSON format or js name of a variable with the binary config.
* `k-flow` - optional, if true the chart will be updated with the new data on every update. See examples.
* `k-id` - optional, this id can be used to link other components to this one.
* `debug` - optional. Can be set to true to see debug prints in the browser console.

## KDBEditor

KDBEditor is based on Ace editor. Q language mode and one theme are provided in `external` directory. If you want to use other language modes and/or other themes download them from the Ace github repository and put them in the same directory where `ace.js` is (they should be noconflict or noconflict-min).

Ace is a very powerful editor and has many settings that can be adjusted via `k-config` attribute. The most useful are `readOnly`, `theme`, `mode`, `showGutter`.

KDBEditor is tightly integrated with `kdb-query` - you can use it as a source for `kdb-query`, `kdb-query` can subscribe to line/selection exec events to execute them, it can update KDBEditor with its result. Actually `kdb-query` and `kdb-editor` can be combined to provide a basic Web Editor with the ability to execute arbitrary queries.

Example:
```
# Basic usage - default settings, static code. !!! Always set width and height of the editor.
<kdb-editor k-style="width:800px; height:250px;">{2*x}til 10</kdb-editor>

# Advanced usage - change some settings, add k-id to allow kdb-query to update the editor, use k-append to define how it should be updated. Use k-query to explicitly subscribe to some query results.
<kdb-editor k-query="myQ" k-append="top" k-id="e2" k-config='{"readOnly":false}' k-style="width:800px; height:250px;">{2*x} each til 10</kdb-editor>
```

Always add `k-ace-editor` css class to your html. It can be found in ace.html example.

Attributes:
* `k-query` - optional, kdb-query `k-id`. `kdb-editor` will subscribe to this query.
* `k-config` - optional, JSON config or a variable name with the config. Use it to change the default settings.
* `k-append` - optional, `overwrite` by default. How to update the editor with the new data - `overwrite`,`top`,`bottom`.
* `k-style` - optional. CSS style for the editor.
* `k-class` - optional, CSS class for the editor. `k-ace-editor` is always added.
* `k-id` - optional, this id can be used to link other components to this one.
* `debug` - optional, print debug info.

Default settings:
```
theme: 'ace/theme/textmate'
mode: 'ace/mode/q'
readOnly: true
scrollPastEnd: false
fadeFoldWidgets: false
behavioursEnabled: true   # editor will be much smarter with this option turned on, it will do correct indentation, match brackets and etc.
useSoftTabs: true
animatedScroll: true
verticalScrollBar: false
horizontalScrollBar: false
highlightSelectedWord: true
showGutter: true
displayIndentGuides: false # gray lines that show where indentation is
showInvisibles: false  # invisible symbols are shown as gray marks
highlightActiveLine: true
selectionStyle: 'line' # line or text - how looks the selection decoration
wrap: 'off' # off 40 80 free (til end of the container)
foldStyle: 'markbegin' # markbegin markbeginend manual - show marks where folding starts, starts and ends or nothing
fontSize: 12
keybindings: 'ace' # ace emacs vim, emacs and vim should be first downloaded
showPrintMargin: true # gray line at 80th column
execLine: win: 'Ctrl-Return', mac: 'Command-Return'
execSelection: win: 'Ctrl-e', mac: 'Command-e'
```

Interface (kdb-editor object):
* `kEditor` - the underlying editor.
* `onexec(f)` - subscribe to exec events.
* `kdbUpd(string)` - update the editor.

## KDBLex

Converts Q text into an array of tokens. It also can produce html from the text.

KDBLex instance is available as KDB.KDBLexer. It can be used with `kdb-query` in `k-filter` attribute to colorify q text.

```
l = new KDB.KDBLex() || KDB.KDBLexer
l.getHtml("a: 100")

Suitable container div:
<div style="line-height:normal;text-autospace:none;font-size: 8pt; font-family: Consolas; white-space: nowrap;"></div>
```

Functions:
* `getTokens(text or array of strings)` - get tokens array.
* `getHtml(text or array of strings, map of token types to css classes or null)` - produce html from text where tokens are wrapped in `span` with the corresponding classes, lines are wrapped in `div`.
* `filter(text)` - to be used with `kdb-query` to post process q text into colored html.

Default types (classes): `k-const`, `k-number-guid`, `k-number-float`, `k-number-int`, `k-number-datetime`, `k-number-time`, `k-number-date`, `k-const-sym`, `k-keyword-language`, `k-command`, `k-keyword-function`, `k-keyword-control`, `k-keyword-operator`, `k-name`, `k-variable`, `k-comment`, `k-simple-comment`, `k-eof-comment`, `k-string`, `k-text`, `k-operator`.

## srv.q

A simple proxy server for html components. It has .z.ph and .z.ws handlers and can forward requests to other servers (via `k-target` attribute on `kdb-srv`). You can update trgMap dictionary in srv.q with logical names (trgMap[\`hdbEMEAstock]:\`:somehost:port) and then set `k-target` like `k-target="hdbEMEAstock"`.

# Examples

Examples can be used to quickly overview all available functionality. Simply start srv.q:
```
q srv.q
```
And enter `localhost:5566/index.html` in your browser.

If you start srv.q from another directory redefine '.h.HOME' to point to srv.q directory otherwise it will not be able to find examples and etc.
